# LA-Dodgers-Sample

The data and code for this project has been white labeled. The project was an open-ended analysis 
of data provided by an NHL organization. The code utilizes two data sets both of which are provided.
The end result of this analysis is a set of charts showing average ticket sales and revenue by day of the week for conference
and non-conference opponents. Additionally, there is a second set of visuals that compare average ticket sales and revenue for
gamedays when a major league baseball team in the same market plays on the same day and when the MLB team does not.
